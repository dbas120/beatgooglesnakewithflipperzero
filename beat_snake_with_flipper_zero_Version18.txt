REM How this works:
REM 1) Start Google Snake in your browser, click the board so it has focus,
REM    pick a slow/non-accelerating mode if available.
REM 2) Put the snake at the top-left, moving RIGHT before you run this.
REM 3) Tune ROW_MS (time to cross one row) and TURN_PAUSE_MS (settle time).

DEFAULT_DELAY 50
REM === Tunables (start here) ===
REM Typical starting point: 20 steps * ~140ms/step = ~2800ms per row.
REM Increase ROW_MS if you crash into the wall; decrease if you turn too early.
REM TURN_PAUSE_MS gives the game a beat after each corner.
REM (Edit these numbers, not the rest, until it lines up.)
REM --------------------------------
REM ROW_MS ≈ time to traverse one full row
REM TURN_PAUSE_MS ≈ a short pause after each turn
REM --------------------------------

REM (Copy/paste more “Block” pairs until you’ve got enough rows for your board.
REM  For many Snake boards ~20 total rows does it—add or remove as needed.)

REM Optional: stop the snake safely by pausing on a long hold at the end.
